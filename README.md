"A road-trip to build our favorite set of oldskool-craftsmen-dev-tools with our bare hands"

 FPC4ALL is an experimental repo to define the FPC4TERMUX blueprint (next-door-repo), meant
 for circular learning, enhancing self-sustainability even on a non-high-end android device..
 Our repo contains combined trunk snapshots of FPC(rev.7ac4e38b) and LAZARUS(rev.aeca9749)..
 On Termux we are going to create a script to build fpc and our own lazarus IDE.. and while
 editing, also make use of conditional define TMX to isolate our code from the rest..
 
 Eventually we are also going to utilize FPCUPDELUXE to make the process less elaborate..
 As "spoiled" Delphi7-pro user I followed the past decades of FreePascal development with
 anticipation and patience, always comparing my "paid" version with the "free" surrogate, and
 now, as the modern Lazarus seems to be on par with Delphi6 with a lot the extras also to be seen
 at modern Delphi releases, we are going to bring that developer environment to Termux including
 all kinds of non-standard features activated to create desktop apps and more cool stuff..

"Hope to surprise you soon with the results of an extra-ordinary educational endeavor.."

With kind regards,

ergo: getting the Castle Game Engine to work was my main drive.. that was a success so
now the experience is used to work more complient at porting from scratch for the better,
we shall see.. yet one thing is for sure.. once build, lazarus and fpc keep working even
if no internet is available what makes them also perfect tools for any offline scenario..
